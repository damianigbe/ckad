CKAD: Understand API Deprecations
As Kubernetes evolves, the APIs and features it provides can change over time. API deprecations are an essential aspect of this evolution. Understanding how Kubernetes manages deprecations and how to handle them in your application development is crucial for ensuring that your workloads remain stable and compatible with future versions of Kubernetes.
In this section, we’ll explore what API deprecations are, why they occur, and how to handle them effectively as a Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD).

1. What Are API Deprecations?
In Kubernetes, API deprecation refers to the process of marking an API or API version as outdated and signaling that it will be removed in a future release. The deprecation process is Kubernetes’ way of ensuring backward compatibility while allowing users time to update their applications and configurations before older versions of APIs are removed.
Why Do API Deprecations Happen?
Improved Features: New versions of APIs may provide more efficient, secure, or feature-rich implementations.
Code Cleanup: Over time, certain API versions may no longer be needed as Kubernetes evolves, and these old versions are deprecated.
Enhanced Performance & Usability: The Kubernetes team may optimize APIs, change field names, or restructure resources to improve performance, usability, and flexibility.
When an API is deprecated, it is typically still available for some time but may show warnings about its deprecation. Eventually, it will be removed in a future release (often a major version).

2. How Kubernetes Marks APIs as Deprecated
Kubernetes marks an API as deprecated in the following ways:
Deprecation Warnings in Logs: When using a deprecated API, Kubernetes emits warning messages indicating the API is deprecated and should be updated.
Documentation: Kubernetes documentation provides clear guidance on which API versions are deprecated and what their replacements are.
API Versioning: Kubernetes has multiple versions of APIs to ensure backward compatibility. Deprecated APIs are often maintained for a while in a version before they are completely removed.
For example, if you are using an older version of an API, such as extensions/v1beta1 for resources like Deployments, you might receive a warning about deprecation in the logs:
W0311 16:10:23.123456       1 warnings.go:67] extensions/v1beta1 deployments is deprecated in v1.19.0+, use apps/v1 instead.


3. Common Kubernetes APIs That Are Deprecated
Over the years, Kubernetes has deprecated several APIs. Some of the most notable deprecated APIs include:
extensions/v1beta1 -> apps/v1 (Deployments, ReplicaSets, etc.):


The extensions/v1beta1 API for resources like Deployments and ReplicaSets was deprecated in favor of the new API group apps/v1.
Example:
 apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1  # Deprecated
kind: Deployment


extensions/v1beta1 -> networking.k8s.io/v1 (Ingress):


The extensions/v1beta1 API for Ingress resources was also deprecated in favor of networking.k8s.io/v1.
Example:
 apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1  # New
kind: Ingress


apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1 -> apiextensions.k8s.io/v1 (CustomResourceDefinitions):


The v1beta1 version of CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) was deprecated in favor of v1.
batch/v1beta1 -> batch/v1 (CronJobs):


The batch/v1beta1 version of CronJobs was deprecated in favor of batch/v1.

4. How to Handle API Deprecations
As a Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD), it’s important to be proactive about handling API deprecations. Here's how you can manage deprecated APIs:
1. Stay Updated with Kubernetes Release Notes
Kubernetes releases new versions regularly (every 3 months), and each release contains a changelog that lists deprecated APIs and their replacements. Staying on top of these changes will allow you to plan your upgrades and refactor your application accordingly.
You can find release notes on the official Kubernetes GitHub page and on Kubernetes documentation.
2. Update Your YAML Manifests
Whenever you encounter deprecation warnings in your Kubernetes environment, you should update your YAML files to use the newer API versions. For example, if you’re using extensions/v1beta1 for Deployments, you should switch to apps/v1.
apiVersion: apps/v1  # New API version
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-app
          image: my-app:latest

3. Use kubectl to Identify Deprecated APIs
You can use the kubectl tool to check for deprecated API versions in your cluster. The kubectl deprecations plugin is available to detect deprecated APIs in your cluster resources:
kubectl deprecations

This tool will give you an overview of the deprecated APIs being used in your cluster and provide guidance on how to update them.
4. Use API Version Migrations
If the deprecated API is still functional, Kubernetes will generally provide a migration path. Kubernetes’ API reference documentation and release notes will help you understand how to migrate from deprecated versions to newer, stable ones.
For example:
Migrate from extensions/v1beta1 to apps/v1 for Deployments.
Migrate from extensions/v1beta1 to networking.k8s.io/v1 for Ingress.
5. Test Changes in Staging Environments
Before deploying changes that involve deprecated API migrations to production, test your application thoroughly in a staging environment. This ensures that the new API versions don’t break your application and that the transition is smooth.
6. Leverage Kubernetes Features for Compatibility
Kubernetes supports multi-version compatibility for a certain period. This means you can run multiple versions of APIs for a while (e.g., apps/v1 and extensions/v1beta1) in the same cluster. However, you should plan to update deprecated APIs before the versions are removed completely in future Kubernetes releases.

5. Deprecation Timeline
Kubernetes provides a deprecation timeline in its release notes. Kubernetes uses a two-year deprecation policy:
A feature marked as deprecated will be supported for two more major versions (around 6 months each).
After the deprecation period ends, the feature is removed.
For instance:
Kubernetes 1.14 marked extensions/v1beta1 APIs (like Deployments and Ingress) as deprecated.
They were fully removed in Kubernetes 1.22.
The deprecation timeline is announced in the release notes, so it's important to stay informed about upcoming changes and plan your application updates accordingly.

6. Benefits of Understanding API Deprecations
Future-proofing: By addressing deprecated APIs early, you ensure that your applications remain compatible with future Kubernetes versions.
Security: Newer API versions often come with security improvements, bug fixes, and better performance.
Stability: By updating deprecated APIs, you avoid the risk of them being removed in future versions, which could break your workloads.
Improved Maintainability: Using up-to-date API versions ensures that your Kubernetes manifests are aligned with the current best practices and Kubernetes standards.

7. Conclusion
As a Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD), staying on top of API deprecations is a critical skill to ensure that your applications remain compatible with newer versions of Kubernetes. By:
Regularly reviewing release notes for deprecated APIs.
Updating your YAML configurations to use current APIs.
Testing changes in non-production environments.
You can ensure your Kubernetes applications are future-proof and continue to work seamlessly as Kubernetes evolves.
Pro tip: Utilize tools like kubectl deprecations and check Kubernetes' release notes to track deprecations and plan your updates accordingly.
