CKAD: Debugging in Kubernetes
Debugging is a critical skill for a Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD). Kubernetes is a powerful platform for deploying and managing containerized applications, but it introduces complexity, especially when issues arise. Whether it's a misconfigured deployment, a failed Pod, or a networking issue, knowing how to debug and troubleshoot effectively is essential.
This section will cover the tools and techniques you can use to debug applications and Kubernetes resources.

1. Key Debugging Concepts in Kubernetes
When debugging in Kubernetes, it's important to understand the following key concepts:
Pod Lifecycle: Pods can go through various states like Pending, Running, Succeeded, or Failed. Understanding the lifecycle helps identify where a problem might be occurring.
Kubernetes Resources: Debugging Kubernetes resources (like Pods, Deployments, Services, and ConfigMaps) involves checking their configurations, status, and logs.
Cluster Context: Debugging often requires understanding the cluster context, including node status, kubelet logs, and network configuration.
Container Behavior: Problems with containers themselves (such as crashes, memory limits, or network timeouts) often manifest in the container logs.

2. Common Debugging Scenarios in Kubernetes
As an application developer, you'll face several common issues when working with Kubernetes. Here are some of the most frequent ones:
Pods Not Starting: Pods that are stuck in the Pending or CrashLoopBackOff state.
Service Unavailability: Pods are running but cannot be accessed via the Kubernetes Service.
Configuration Issues: Incorrect ConfigMaps, Secrets, or environment variables affecting the behavior of the application.
Resource Constraints: Pods or containers being terminated or restarted due to memory or CPU constraints.

3. Debugging Tools and Techniques
Kubernetes provides a variety of tools and commands to debug these issues. Here’s a breakdown of the most useful debugging techniques:

1. kubectl describe
The kubectl describe command provides detailed information about Kubernetes resources. It's extremely useful for debugging issues with Pods, Services, Deployments, and more.
Pods: To describe a Pod, use the following command:

 kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
 This will give you details about the Pod, including events, container status, resource usage, and any error messages.


Example output: If a Pod is stuck in Pending or CrashLoopBackOff, kubectl describe pod <pod-name> will often provide insight into what’s going wrong (e.g., resource allocation, failed pull image, etc.).


2. kubectl logs
Logs are one of the most effective ways to understand what's happening inside a container. If a Pod is crashing or behaving unexpectedly, check its logs:
Basic logs:

 kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <container-name>


Stream logs in real-time:

 kubectl logs -f <pod-name> -c <container-name>


Previous logs: If the container crashed and was restarted, you can view logs from the previous instance:

 kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <container-name> --previous


Logs often provide the most direct insight into why a container is failing, such as uncaught exceptions, resource issues, or missing dependencies.
3. kubectl get
The kubectl get command is used to retrieve information about Kubernetes resources. It can be helpful to view the current state of resources and identify any issues.
Pods: To get information about the status of Pods in a namespace:

 kubectl get pods -n <namespace>


Deployment: To check the status of a deployment:

 kubectl get deployment <deployment-name> -n <namespace>


Services: To check the Services running in the cluster:

 kubectl get svc -n <namespace>


The output will show the current state, such as whether the Pods are running, and if there are any issues with resource allocation.
4. kubectl top
The kubectl top command is used to monitor resource usage (CPU and memory) for nodes and Pods. It can help identify if your application is running out of resources.
Monitor nodes:

 kubectl top nodes


Monitor Pods:

 kubectl top pods -n <namespace>


If a Pod is experiencing memory or CPU issues, it may be terminated or fail to start. kubectl top helps identify these problems.
5. kubectl port-forward
If you need to debug an application from inside a Pod, the kubectl port-forward command allows you to access an application running inside a Kubernetes cluster without exposing it externally.
Example command:

 kubectl port-forward pod/<pod-name> 8080:80


This forwards port 8080 on your local machine to port 80 inside the container. This is useful for debugging an application’s behavior from your local machine without exposing it to the public internet.
6. kubectl exec
The kubectl exec command allows you to execute commands directly inside a running container. This is useful for inspecting the state of an application or running debugging tools in the container.
Example command:

 kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -c <container-name> -- /bin/bash


This opens an interactive terminal session inside the container, allowing you to run commands such as ps, top, curl, etc., to investigate the issue.
7. Checking Events
Kubernetes events provide insights into what’s happening in the cluster, including Pod creation, failure, and resource allocation issues. You can view events using:
kubectl get events -n <namespace>

Events help identify why a Pod might be stuck in the Pending state, why it was evicted, or why a deployment failed to rollout.

4. Troubleshooting Common Issues
Here are some common issues and how to debug them:
1. Pod Stuck in Pending
Check the Pod’s events: Often, Pods stuck in the Pending state are waiting for resources (like CPU or memory). Use kubectl describe pod <pod-name> to see if there are any warnings about resource availability.


Check resource requests/limits: If your Pod is requesting more resources than are available, it may not be scheduled. Check if the Pod has resource requests/limits set appropriately.


2. Pod Crashes or Restarts (CrashLoopBackOff)
View logs: Use kubectl logs <pod-name> to see what’s happening in the container. Look for errors like missing files, connection issues, or configuration problems.


Check for resource issues: Make sure the container isn't being killed due to resource limits (memory/CPU). Use kubectl top pods to monitor usage.


Check readiness/liveness probes: A misconfigured probe can cause Kubernetes to restart the Pod frequently. Review the health check configurations.


3. Service Not Accessible
Verify Service: Use kubectl describe svc <service-name> to ensure the Service is correctly pointing to the Pods and has the correct ports.


Check Network Policies: Ensure there are no network policies blocking access to the service.


Check Pod Logs: If the application inside the Pod is failing to respond to requests, check the logs of the container to ensure the application is running and listening on the expected port.


4. Misconfigured Environment Variables or ConfigMaps
Inspect ConfigMap/Secret: Use kubectl describe configmap <configmap-name> or kubectl describe secret <secret-name> to ensure that the correct environment variables are being set.


Check Pods’ Environment: Use kubectl exec to inspect the environment inside the container to ensure that variables are correctly passed.



5. Debugging Network Issues
Networking problems often occur when Pods are unable to communicate with each other, a service, or the outside world. Common network issues include DNS resolution problems, service misconfiguration, or blocked ports.
Test Connectivity: Use kubectl exec to ping other Pods or services to verify connectivity.


Check Network Policies: Ensure that Kubernetes network policies are not unintentionally blocking traffic.


Check DNS Resolution: If Pods cannot resolve domain names, it might indicate a DNS issue. Check the CoreDNS logs using kubectl logs -n kube-system <coredns-pod-name>.



6. Conclusion
Debugging is a crucial skill for a Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD). Kubernetes provides several powerful tools and commands like kubectl describe, kubectl logs, kubectl exec, and kubectl top to help you troubleshoot and identify issues with Pods, containers, and other resources.
By familiarizing yourself with these tools and techniques, you will be better equipped to identify, diagnose, and resolve issues in your Kubernetes-based applications, ensuring smooth operation in a cloud-native environment.
